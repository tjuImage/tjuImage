Microsoft Project Oxford Text-to-Speech client SDK and samples
==================================================

This repo contains the client libraries that demonstrate Microsoft’s algorithms
to generate spoken language. With this APIs developers can easily convert text
to spoken audio. When applications need to “talk” back to their users, this API
can be used to convert text that is generated by the app into audio that can be
played back to the user. See the tech in action on [our demo
page](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/demo/speech>) or learn more about the API
with [our documentation](<https://www.projectoxford.ai/doc/speech/overview>).
